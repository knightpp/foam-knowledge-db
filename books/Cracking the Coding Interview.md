* Start Something: Build a project on your own time, participate in hackathons, or contribute to an open source project. It doesn't matter too much what it is. The important thing is that you're coding. Not only will this develop your technical skills and practical experience,your initiative will impress companies.
* Use Your Nights and Weekends: If you have some free time, use it to build a mobile app, a web app, or a piece of desktop software. Doing such projects is also a great way to get experience with new technolo- gies, making you more relevant to today's companies. This project work should definitely be listed on your resume; few things are as impressive to an Interviewer as a candidate who built something "just for fun".
* To crack the coding interview, you need to prepare with real interview questions. You must practice on real problems and learn their patterns. It's about developing a fresh algorithm, not memorizing existing problems.
